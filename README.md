# Expo CLI: Uncommon Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet often-difficult-to-diagnose issue in Expo CLI projects: incompatibility between third-party libraries, native modules, and the Expo SDK version.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of code that might trigger such an error, while `bugSolution.js` provides solutions and best practices to prevent and resolve these issues.

## Problem Description:

The primary cause of these errors lies in using libraries or features that require specific native modules or functionalities not fully supported by the current Expo SDK. This often leads to runtime errors that are not easily identifiable.

## Solutions:

The `bugSolution.js` file showcases several approaches to mitigate and fix these issues:

1. **Check Library Compatibility:** Verify that all libraries used in your project are compatible with the Expo SDK version you are using. Consult library documentation and release notes.
2. **Proper Installation:**  Always ensure correct installation of libraries using `expo install <library>`. 
3. **Expo SDK Version:** Keep your Expo SDK version up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes and compatibility improvements. Use `expo upgrade`.
4. **Native Modules:**  If a library demands specific native modules, explore whether Expo's managed workflow supports them or if you need to use the bare workflow.
5. **Debugging:** Utilize Expo's debugging tools and logs to gain more insight into the error messages.
